# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you
can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

- [Essentials](./design-pattern-essentials)

> **Base of design patterns - Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction & Polymorphism.**

- [SOLID Principles](./solid-design-principles)

> **SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable**

- [Creational](./creational-design-patterns)

> **Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.**

- [Structural](./structural-design-patterns)

> **Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.**

- [Behavioral](./behavorial-design-patterns)

> **Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.**

- [Others](./misc-design-patterns)

> **Collection of miscellaneous design patterns/approaches like currying, unit of work etc.**

## Wisdom

- _Don't overly complicate your code by just following the design patterns blindly_
- _Simplicity is more sophisticated_
